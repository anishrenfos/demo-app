### Blocks
This section deals with managing **_blocks_** or areas within your web pages. You can find the blocks on the navigation menu bar on the left side. You’ll find the below screen with two divisions - 

1. A quick button to add new block.
2. A list of already created blocks.

#### Let’s start beginning with creating a block
Press on the ![create block button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LavaLite/docs/master/images/blocks/block-buttons/create-blovk-button.png) button or ![new button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LavaLite/docs/master/images/pages/page-buttons/new-page-bue-button.png) button to create a new block and you will find a new form to add the block details that is newly going to be created.

Here in the block creation form you will have different option to make the newly created block equipped with new features. Where you can find two tabs - Block and Images
_The Block Tab_
Here you need to mention all the specs that are related to creation of a page block - includes, name of the block, category(the section where you need the block to be placed - categories are mentioned programmatically), status (hide/show), order(a numerical, chronological order in which the blocks are arranged), URL(a well defined url path name for the block, if it is expected to be relocated to other location.), block icon image, color(which is related to the block styles), a long description for the block.
_The Images Tab_
You can upload images under a particular block, if needed.

#### Editing a block
While selecting blocks from the navigation menu you can find the list of blocks that you have already added. Select a block row from the list
