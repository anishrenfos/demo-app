### Tasks
This section deals with managing **_the tasks_** that are relevant for day-to-day operations in an organisation.
You’ll find the below screen of task lists which were characterized under various task groups such as,

1. To-do List
2. In Progress
3. Completed

You can find a quick form to add a new task

Put some meaningful wordings and fire the **_Add Task_** button.

#### Drag and Drop Feature
The task list entries are easily manageable - switching them from one set of list to another by the drag and dropping feature.
